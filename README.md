# Calculator App

A simple calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

This project helped me practice **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **JavaScript logic** to create a fully functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
